# Node-isassemble Johnny-Five

_Artwork by [Mike Sgier](http://msgierillustration.com)_

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rwaldron/johnny-five.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rwaldron/johnny-five) [![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/rwaldron/johnny-five?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)


#### Johnny-Five is an Open Source, Firmata Protocol based, IoT and Robotics programming framework, developed at [Bocoup](http://bocoup.com). Johnny-Five programs can be written for Arduino (all models), Electric Imp, Beagle Bone, Intel Galileo & Edison, Linino One, Pinoccio, Raspberry Pi, Spark Core, TI Launchpad and more!

Johnny-Five does not attempt to provide "all the things", but instead focuses on delivering robust, reality tested, highly composable APIs that behave consistently across all supported hardware platforms. Johnny-Five wants to be a baseline control kit for hardware projects, allowing you the freedom to build, grow and experiment with diverse JavaScript libraries of your own choice. Johnny-Five couples comfortably with: 

- Popular application libraries such as [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/) and [Socket.io](http://socket.io/).
- Fellow hardware projects like [ar-drone](https://github.com/felixge/node-ar-drone), [Aerogel](https://github.com/ceejbot/aerogel) and [Spheron](https://github.com/alchemycs/spheron)
- Bluetooth game controllers like [XBox Controller](https://github.com/andrew/node-xbox-controller) and [DualShock](https://github.com/rdepena/node-dualshock-controller)
- IoT frameworks, such as [Octoblu](http://www.octoblu.com/)

...And that's only a few of the many explorable possibilities. Check out these exciting projects: [node-pulsesensor](https://www.npmjs.org/package/node-pulsesensor), [footballbot-workshop-ui](https://www.npmjs.org/package/footballbot-workshop-ui), [nodebotui](https://www.npmjs.org/package/nodebotui), [dublin-disco](https://www.npmjs.org/package/dublin-disco), [node-slot-car-bot](https://www.npmjs.org/package/node-slot-car-bot), [servo-calibrator](https://www.npmjs.org/package/servo-calibrator), [node-ardx](https://www.npmjs.org/package/node-ardx), [nodebot-workshop](https://www.npmjs.org/package/nodebot-workshop), [phone-home](https://www.npmjs.org/package/phone-home), [purple-unicorn](https://www.npmjs.org/package/purple-unicorn), [webduino](https://www.npmjs.org/package/webduino), [leapduino](https://www.npmjs.org/package/leapduino), [lasercat-workshop](https://www.npmjs.org/package/lasercat-workshop), [simplesense](https://www.npmjs.org/package/simplesense), [five-redbot](https://www.npmjs.org/package/five-redbot), [robotnik](https://www.npmjs.org/package/robotnik), [the-blender](https://www.npmjs.org/package/the-blender)

## Supported Hardware

Johnny-Five has been tested on a variety of Arduino-compatible [Boards](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five/wiki/Board).

For non-Arduino based projects, a number of platform-specific [IO Plugins](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five/wiki/IO-Plugins) are available. IO Plugins allow Johnny-Five code to communicate with any non-Arduino based hardware in whatever language that platforms speaks!

Here is a list of [prerequisites](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five/wiki/Prerequites) for Linux, OSX or Windows.

Check out the [bluetooth guide](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five/wiki/JY-MCU-Bluetooth-Serial-Port-Module-Notes) if you want to remotely control your robot.

## Setup and Assemble Arduino

- Recommended Starting Kit: [Sparkfun Inventor's Kit](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12001)
- Download [Arduino IDE](http://arduino.cc/en/main/software)
- Plug in your Arduino or Arduino compatible microcontroller via USB
- Open the Arduino IDE, select: File > Examples > Firmata > StandardFirmata
- Click the "Upload" button.

If the upload was successful, the board is now prepared and you can close the Arduino IDE.

For non-Arduino projects, each IO Plugin's repo will provide its own platform specific setup instructions.


## Hey you, here's Johnny!

#### Source Code:

``` bash
git clone git://github.com/rwldrn/johnny-five.git && cd johnny-five

npm install
```

#### npm package:

Install the module with:

```bash
npm install johnny-five
```


## Johnny-Five is...

```javascript
var five = require("johnny-five"),
    // or "./lib/johnny-five" when running from the source
    board = new five.Board();

board.on("ready", function() {

  // Create an Led on pin 13 and strobe it on/off
  // Optionally set the speed; defaults to 100ms
  (new five.Led(13)).strobe();

});
```
[Watch it here!](http://jsfiddle.net/rwaldron/dtudh/show/light)

> Note: Node will crash if you try to run johnny-five in the node REPL, but board instances will create their own contextual REPL. Put your script in a file.
